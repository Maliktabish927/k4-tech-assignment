ASSIGNMENT

Q1. Can Artificial Intelligence (AI) play games (like HTML5 Games similar to this -    https://k4.games/)? If yes, how can you use concepts of computer vision to prove this and tool you need to use.

Ans:- Yes, AI can play HTML5 games, including those on platforms like k4.games. This involves integrating several AI techniques, including reinforcement learning, computer vision, and game environment interaction.
Using Computer Vision to Play Games
1.	Game State Recognition:
o	Screenshot Capture: Regularly capture screenshots of the game.
o	Image Processing: Use computer vision techniques to process these screenshots to understand the game state. This could involve detecting game elements like characters, obstacles, scores, etc.
o	Object Detection: Apply object detection models (like YOLO, SSD) to identify and locate relevant objects within the game screen.
2.	Decision Making:
o	Reinforcement Learning (RL): Train an AI agent using RL algorithms where the agent learns to make decisions based on the game state. Techniques like Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), or more advanced methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) can be employed.
o	Reward System: Define rewards for achieving certain goals or making progress in the game, which will guide the RL agent's learning process.
3.	Action Execution:
o	Simulating Inputs: Programmatically simulate keyboard or mouse inputs based on the decisions made by the AI agent to interact with the game.
Tools Needed
1.	Computer Vision Libraries:
o	OpenCV: For capturing and processing game screenshots.
o	TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch: For implementing and training object detection models.
2.	Reinforcement Learning Frameworks:
o	Stable Baselines3: A set of reliable implementations of RL algorithms.
o	OpenAI Gym: To create a simulated environment if the game can be abstracted.
3.	Screen Capture and Input Simulation:
o	PyAutoGUI: For capturing screenshots and simulating mouse and keyboard inputs.
o	Selenium: For interacting with web-based games programmatically.


Example Workflow
1.	Capture Screenshots:
o	Use OpenCV to capture the game screen at regular intervals.
Code:-
import cv2
import numpy as np
import pyautogui

screenshot = pyautogui.screenshot()
frame = np.array(screenshot)
frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

2.	Detect Game Elements:
o	Use a pre-trained object detection model to identify elements within the game screen.
Code:-
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

model = load_model('path_to_your_model.h5')
detections = model.predict(frame)
3.	Train RL Agent:
o	Define the environment, rewards, and actions, then train the agent.
Code:-
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from gym import Env, spaces

class GameEnv(Env):
    def __init__(self):
        # Define action and observation space
        self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(number_of_actions)
        self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=0, high=255, shape=(height, width, channels), dtype=np.uint8)

    def step(self, action):
        # Execute action and return new state, reward, done, info
        pass

    def reset(self):
        # Reset the game and return the initial state
        pass

env = GameEnv()
model = PPO('CnnPolicy', env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)

4.	Simulate Inputs:
o	Use PyAutoGUI to perform actions in the game based on the agent's decisions.
Code:-
pyautogui.press('left')  # Example action

Developing Basic Tools for AI Animation
To develop some basic tools for AI animation, follow these steps:
1.	Set Up Your Environment:
o	Install Python and relevant libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and FFmpeg.
2.	Data Collection and Preprocessing:
o	Collect or create a dataset of images or video frames.
o	Preprocess the data by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting to prepare it for training.
3.	Model Training:
o	Train a GAN (like StyleGAN or Pix2Pix) on your dataset to generate or modify images.
o	Use pre-trained models if available to save time and resources.
4.	Animation Creation:
o	Generate frames using your trained model.
o	Use OpenCV or similar libraries to stitch these frames together into a video.
5.	Post-Processing:
o	Enhance the video using tools like FFmpeg or Adobe After Effects.
o	Add effects, transitions, and audio if needed.
Example Workflow
1.	Data Preparation:
Code:-
import cv2
import os

def prepare_data(video_path, output_folder):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    frame_count = 0
    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        frame_path = os.path.join(output_folder, f'frame_{frame_count:05d}.png')
        cv2.imwrite(frame_path, frame)
        frame_count += 1
    cap.release()

prepare_data('input_video.mp4', 'frames/')
2.	Model Training (Using a Pre-trained GAN):
Code:-
from keras.preprocessing import image
from keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np

# Load pre-trained model
model = load_model('pretrained_gan.h5')

def generate_images(input_folder, output_folder, model):
    for img_name in os.listdir(input_folder):
        img_path = os.path.join(input_folder, img_name)
        img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(256, 256))
        img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
        img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
        generated_img = model.predict(img_array)
        generated_img = np.squeeze(generated_img, axis=0)
        generated_img_path = os.path.join(output_folder, img_name)
        image.save_img(generated_img_path, generated_img)

generate_images('frames/', 'generated_frames/', model)
3.	Video Creation:
Code:-
import cv2
import os

def create_video(input_folder, output_video_path):
    images = sorted([img for img in os.listdir(input_folder) if img.endswith(".png")])
    frame = cv2.imread(os.path.join(input_folder, images[0]))
    height, width, layers = frame.shape
    video = cv2.VideoWriter(output_video_path, cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'DIVX'), 30, (width, height))
    
    for image in images:
        video.write(cv2.imread(os.path.join(input_folder, image)))
    
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    video.release()

create_video('generated_frames/', 'output_video.avi')
By following these steps, you can create a basic tool for AI animation.
